# Sorting-Algorithms-Project-Challenge
**Computer Science A Level Mini-Project**

Basic Specification â€“ the program will:
+ [x] Requirement 1: Create a list of unsorted random integers
+ [x] Requirement 2: Be able to perform a bubble sort or an insertion sort on a list
+ [x] Requirement 3: Calculate and record the time taken to perform the selected sort.
+ [x] Requirement 4: Provide the user with relevant and appropriate feedback.
+ [ ] Requirement 5: Add a command line interface which allows the user to specific the size of the list and the type of sort to use.




+ **Task 1 Planning: [10 marks]**
  + Analyse the requirements and decompose the problem [2 marks]
  + Produce a brief design document showing the components of your proposed solution (including appropriate pseudocode and flowcharts)  [8 marks]
+ **Task 2 Development: [20 marks]**
  + Develop the solution according to the design document produced in task 1.
  + Ensure your code is suitable structured and annotated with comments
+ **Task 3 Testing: [20 marks]**
  + Test the program using the following datasets sizes and both sorting algorithms:
  + 100 elements
  + 1000 elements
  + 5000 elements
  + Produce annotated screen prints of the application running (evidence of testing). Comment on the performance of each algorithm
+ **Task 4: Submission Instruction**
  + Copy and paste your code into a single word processed document, along with your planning document, evidence of the program running and test results.
  + Save the document in PORTABLE DOCUMENT FORMAT (PDF) only and upload here for marking.
